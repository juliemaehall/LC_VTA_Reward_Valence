* GLM repeated measure analysis analyzing the beta values of the LC OR SN/VTA for the factors reward, valence and event 

GLM reward valence event
  /WSFACTOR=reward(2) valence(3) event(2)  *  Within-subject factors and their levels.
  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)  *  Type III sums of squares
  /REPEATED= reward valence event | MEASURE=beta_LC  * Defines repeated measures and the dependent variable.
  /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)  * Sets the alpha level for significance tests at .05.
  /DESIGN= reward valence event reward*valence reward*event valence*event reward*valence*event.  
* Specifies the model design, including all main effects and interactions.

* paired t-test
